As it turns out, the reason some links were missing is because the api only allows you to retrieve the 100 most recently follows for a user.<br /><br />So with the 10 people I follow who follow over 100 people, there were some connections missing. So being the oddly determined character I am, I went through these people's follows by hand, looking for any missing connections. Et viola:<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TFSVp02evuI/AAAAAAAAAF8/cPsNE5ScvIs/s1600/Graph2wRed.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="355" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TFSVp02evuI/AAAAAAAAAF8/cPsNE5ScvIs/s400/Graph2wRed.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />This is a stripped down version of the one featured in yesterday's post - people who never tweet [dead accounts] are omitted.<br /><br />In case you were wondering, shinelikestars6 has a red circle on account of him being my nemesis. And he insisted upon it. The interactive version is <a href="http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/visualizations/friend-follows-version-3">here</a>.<br /><br />Here it is without me in the graph [interactive <a href="http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/visualizations/friend-follows-version-4">here</a>]:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TFSovWycD_I/AAAAAAAAAGM/ykbe0KT-shw/s1600/sans-graph1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="255" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TFSovWycD_I/AAAAAAAAAGM/ykbe0KT-shw/s400/sans-graph1.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />And finally, here's a different approach I tried:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TFSliv3QjuI/AAAAAAAAAGE/4DGScl7SQuI/s1600/loop-graph.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TFSliv3QjuI/AAAAAAAAAGE/4DGScl7SQuI/s320/loop-graph.jpg" /></a></div><br />It gives a slightly different view of the connections - slightly clearer. It's hand drawn, cause, well, it was just easier to do it that way.<br /><br />The interesting thing I found while doing this was that some people I  thought followed each other, in fact, don't. But there you go.<br /><br />The  other thing I tried to do was a video showing the connections being  formed over time. But the result was a complete mess, and nothing like  what I had in mind. Still, I've got the data, so if I ever work out a  better way of doing it - watch this space... <br /><br />Oatzy.
