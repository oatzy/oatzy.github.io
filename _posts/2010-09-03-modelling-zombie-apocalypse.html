..Or why, when the zombie apocalypse comes, we're all screwed.<br /><br /><br /><b>Maths of Epidemics</b><br /><br />The spread of an infection through a population can be modeled with variations on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_model#The_SIR_Model">Kermack-McKendrick Model</a>. In this approach the population is divided into three groups:<br /><br />1) <i>Susceptible</i> - not yet infected, but able to catch the infection<br />2) <i>Infective</i> - infected individuals, capable of passing on the infection to susceptibles<br />3) <i>Removed</i> - after some period of time, infectives will recover (or die). These are usually considered immune to catching the infection again.<br /><br />You then have a system of differential equations to describe how these groups vary over time, and hence how the infection spreads.<br /><br /><br /><b>How do you model a Zombie Apocalypse?</b><br /><br />In the paper "<a href="http://www.mathstat.uottawa.ca/%7Ersmith/Zombies.pdf">WHEN ZOMBIES ATTACK!: MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF AN OUTBREAK OF ZOMBIE INFECTION</a>", mathematicians at Carleton University modified this model in various ways. In the simplest form, they replaced 'infective' with 'zombie' and allowed a certain proportion of the dead to be resurrected (as zombies).<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TIFJoY-tgjI/AAAAAAAAAUc/DY9rx8OmFbA/s1600/Zombie-basic.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TIFJoY-tgjI/AAAAAAAAAUc/DY9rx8OmFbA/s320/Zombie-basic.png" /></a></div><br />They found that the ultimate outcome of that model, for all conditions, is "Doomsday" - i.e. the entire population zombified or dead.<br /><br />They then modify it for a scenario where the infected are quarantined. What they found is that unless there's sufficient quarantining in the early stages of infection, it's Doomsday again; albeit a slightly delayed one. And since that sort of quarantining would be unfeasible anyway, it's not even worth trying in most cases.<br /><br />The next approach was to replace quarantining with 'cure' - assuming the cure didn't also provide immunity. The result of this model suggests that a state of stable co-existence between humans and zombies could be reached.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TIFKz2Ir_oI/AAAAAAAAAUk/uGEICkoNir4/s1600/Z-Graph-Vacc.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TIFKz2Ir_oI/AAAAAAAAAUk/uGEICkoNir4/s320/Z-Graph-Vacc.png" /></a></div><br /><span id="goog_1226828581"></span><span id="goog_1226828582"></span><br />But again, it's not ideal. You can only make so much of the cure. So the zombies would get you in the end.<br /><br />The final alteration was replacing cure with strategic mass-eradication of zombies at frequent intervals. In this case, the zombie population <i>could</i> (eventually) be completely destroyed. But that is only if the resources for such attacks are available, and if the military (or whoever) act fast enough and often enough. Otherwise... you know... Doomsday..<br /><br /><br />To quote the article:<br /><blockquote>"In summary, a zombie outbreak is likely to lead to the collapse of civilisation [...] As seen in the movies, it is imperative that zombies are dealt with quickly, or else we are all in a great deal of trouble."</blockquote><br />So basically, unless we can wipe out the zombies quickly, trying to fight and survive is just delaying the inevitable.<br /><br />You might as well just accept your fate and get to work munching on those delicious BBRRRAAAAAIIIIINNSS!!!<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.
