I'm sticking these in a new post, rather than updating the <a href="http://oatzy.blogspot.com/2011/01/snakes-and-ladders.html">last post</a> (and potentially, nobody seeing them).<br /><br /><br />First of all, as I said yesterday, the 'entrance' squares of the snakes and ladders don't technically exist; in so much as, as soon as you land on them you move to the coresponding exit. So I updated the network graph to reflect this<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TUSDr8u1r1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/mDhnKmZWaEQ/s1600/sl-board-graph.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="282" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TUSDr8u1r1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/mDhnKmZWaEQ/s400/sl-board-graph.png" width="400" /></a></div>But this version isn't quite as aesthetically pleasing as the other one. Still, at least no-one can accuse me of not doing it right.<br /><br />And as you'd probably expect, the number of curves directed into a given square's node in the above graph is loosely related to the probability of visiting that square<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TUSGWRzjdHI/AAAAAAAAAeM/T3BKWmp-dhg/s1600/indegree-sim-comp.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="191" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TUSGWRzjdHI/AAAAAAAAAeM/T3BKWmp-dhg/s400/indegree-sim-comp.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />And the other thing is, I wasn't happy with the board histogram - the bar chart of how often you land on each square. So I played with it a bit, to try and find the clearest, prettiest, and most easy to interpret representation of the data.<br /><br />This is what I came up with<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TUSE5BQj3TI/AAAAAAAAAeI/f1CG7yTBBzE/s1600/Snakes-and-ladders2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TUSE5BQj3TI/AAAAAAAAAeI/f1CG7yTBBzE/s400/Snakes-and-ladders2.png" width="400" /></a></div>The numbers for entrances and exits are stacked, so you can see how often a given exit square is visited in total, and what proportion of those visits are from moving along a snake or ladder.<br /><br />For example, there's about a <i>47%</i> chance of getting to the end via the <i>80-100</i> ladder.<br /><br />The arcs show which squares are linked.<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.
