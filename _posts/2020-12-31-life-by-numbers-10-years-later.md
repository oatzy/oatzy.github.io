## Are you ten years ago

Ten years ago, I did a pair of blogs called [Life by Numbers](https://oatzy.github.io/2010/08/31/life-by-numbers.html), and [Life by Numbers: End of Year Review](https://oatzy.github.io/2011/01/01/life-by-numbers-end-of-year-report.html), in which I reviewed a load of stats that I had collected (or that had been collected) about myself.

Aggregating data has gotten somewhat easier since 10 years ago, since now I'm getting end-of-year emails from various websites.

So, lets review...


## Music

(via Spotify/[Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/oatzy))

<br/>

*Total time listening to music*: 55,572 minutes (~2.5 hours / day)

*Total listens*: 15,313 (41 / day)

*Total artists*: 2,743

*Total Albums*: 4,468

*Total (unique) tracks*: 5,344

<br/>

*Most listened artist*: [Carly Rae Jepsen](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6sFIWsNpZYqfjUpaCgueju) (449 plays, 1,369 minutes)

*Most listened song*: [Science, Allie X](https://open.spotify.com/track/6OteeaJa1FSjBA6o1Ixwfq) (49 plays)

*Most listened album*: [Future Nostalgia, Dua Lipa](https://open.spotify.com/album/7fJJK56U9fHixgO0HQkhtI?si=0NMI5RrhT8mRNnwXh_cNvw) (252 plays)

<br/>

My most listened track from 10 years ago ([Change, Karnivool](https://open.spotify.com/track/655JyswXVzEplsb54DiOrl)) has moved down to 466th, with only 6 plays, and my most listened album from 10 years ago ([Sound Awake, Karnivool](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yfy90oEyeRtZU2v03C9QW?si=k74LiPukTKe9ag8OTumKng)) has moved down to 37th, with 42 plays

Note - there's some disagreement about the most played song between spotify and last.fm, possibly because last.fm didn't capture all my listens. However, since spotify doesn't provide all the numbers, any that are unavailable are based off last.fm

## Books

(via [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3339083-chris-oates))

<br/>

*Books read cover to cover*: 4

*Favourites*:
- [The End of Policing, Alex Vitale](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35403039-the-end-of-policing)
- [Hypersanity: Thinking Beyond Thinking, Neel Burton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51316505-hypersanity)

*Books started by not finished (yet)*: 10

### Audiobooks

*Audiobooks read*: 35

*Hours of audiobooks listened*: 345

*Some favourites*:
- [Blitzed: Drugs in Nazi Germany, Norman Ohler](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29429893-blitzed)
- [Bullshit Jobs: A Theory, David Graeber](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs)
- [The Caped Crusader: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture, Glen Weldon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276413-the-caped-crusade)
- [The Pragmatic Programmer, Andy Hunt + Dave Thomas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer)
- [Supergods, Grant Morrison](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10081832-supergods)

(via Audible)

I'm a slow reader, so audiobooks are great for me. I've had a physical copy of Supergods for years, but never got around to reading past the first chapter... until now!

I don't know if that 345 hours figure takes into account that I listen at 2.25x speed.

### Comics

*Graphic novels/collected editions read*: 19

Including the whole [Locke and Key](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49478-locke-key) series, and the first 8 volumes of the [Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist](https://www.goodreads.com/series/59770-yu-gi-oh-duelist) manga (the basis for the first arch of the animated series).

## Movies

*Movies seen at the cinema*: 2
- [Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527338?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [Birds of Prey, and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7713068/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)

I didn't brave the cinema to see Tenet.

<br/>

*Total movies seen this year*: 120

*Total hours of movies watched*: 204 (4h / week)

<br/>

In the previous post, I mentioned films rented on LoveFilm. Since then, LoveFilm was acquired by Amazon, and then shutdown. A disappointing move, given it takes longer for new films to be available on streaming, vs disk rental.

In leiu of cinemas, we got in to the habit of watching a film every Sunday (movie night!). Amongst those films, we've watched the entire [Karate Kid](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) series, the entire [Ip Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1220719/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_6) series, and also some films not about martial arts.

## TV

(via [trakt](https://trakt.tv/users/oatzy))

<br/>

*Total TV episodes watched*: 2,754

*Total hours of TV watched*: 1,494 (4h / day)

Trakt won't tell me the split of tv episode view to movies unless I pay for premium. But since I know the number of films, I can subtract to get the number of episodes.

<br/>

*Unique TV shows watched*: 221

i.e. TV show for which I watched one or more episodes this year

*Some favourite 2020 shows*:
- [Brave New World](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9814116?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [Lovecraft Country](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6905686?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8879940?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [The Owl House](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8050756?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [Perry Mason (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2077823?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3)
- [Queen's Gambit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10048342?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [Saved by the Bell (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11032396?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)

- [Ted Lasso](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986410?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10314462?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)

<br/>

*Old series binge watched*: 7
- Archer
- Harlots
- The Americans
- The Office (US)
- Samurai Jack
- She-Ra and the Princesses of Power
- Venture Bros

<br/>

*Streaming services*: 6

3 of my own, 3 shared.

### Anime

This was the year I got into anime.

*Classic series binge watched*: 3
- Cowboy Bebop
- Gurren Lagann
- Neon Genesis Evangelion

I also finished off Kill-La-Kill, which I had started several years ago. I'm currently working through My Hero Academia and Sword Art Online (amongst others).

In case you're wondering, I watch dubs, because I'm a pleb (and like to multitask)


## Games

*Games bought*: 2
- Pok√©mon Sword
- Layton's Mystery Journey

Both for the Nintendo Switch. Funnily enough, the 2 games I bought 10 years ago were also a Pokemon and a Layton game.

## Podcasts

*Approx average listening per day*: 6 hours

*Podcasts subscribed to*: 83

Note - I use [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/), which provides only 'all time' stats. Since March 2015, I've listened ~297 days. Averaging gives a value of only 3.5 hours, which is an underestimate for this year. This also doesn't include [Last Podcast on the Left](https://open.spotify.com/show/3yZg2MCkf31pPXiG4nznrg), which I'm forced to listen to through Spotify.

<br/>

*Some favourites*:
- [The Daily Zeitgeist](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-the-daily-zeitgeist-28516718/)
- [Hit Parade](https://slate.com/podcasts/hit-parade)
- [The Infinity Podcast](https://theinfinitypod.libsyn.com/)
- [Talking Simpsons](https://talkingsimpsons.libsyn.com/)
- [We Hate Movies](https://www.whmpodcast.com/)

I listen to podcasts while I work. I listen at 2.5x speed, which may seem like it would be incomprehensible. It is a little, at first. But once you get used to it, the speed feels perfectly natural. In fact, switching back to 1x makes voices sound unnaturally slow and sleepy by comparison.

## YouTube

*Approx average viewing per day*: 1.5 hours

*Channels subscribed to*: 239

*Some favourites*:
- [Alex Meyers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY6Ij8zOds0WJEeqCLOnqOQ)
- [Curio](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJmlCcnfMlyPA2oSbb072QA)
- [Folding Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNtlmLB73-7gtlBz00XOQQ)
- [Lindsey Ellis](https://www.youtube.com/user/chezapoctube)
- [Mr Sunday Movies](https://www.youtube.com/user/mrsundaymovies)
- [Patrick H Willems](https://www.youtube.com/user/patrickhwillems)
- [Quinton Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM0V8r4kuIWIl6Sy-NHj2lg)
- [Renegade Cut](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9infsKo33_2LUoiqXGgQWg)
- [Sideways](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi7l9chXMljpUft67vw78qw)
- [Trash Theory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHcoI9ndIdAihEB7ODTOfQ)

YouTube doesn't provide usage statistics. Also, I disabled watch history.

Mostly I watch video essays. Similar to podcasts, I watch at 2x speed.

## Lifestyle

I stopped tracking things like sleep and eating habits a while ago. It became more trouble than it was worth. But anecdotally

<br/>

*Average night's sleep*: 7.5 hours

*Typically asleep between*: 12:30am and 8am

on work days, at least. This is shifted about 2 hours earlier than 10 years ago, when I was unemployed.

<br/>

*Approx average cups of tea per day*: 5

Up from ~3.5 10 years ago, mostly because I'm awake earlier in the day (for work).

*Approx average units of alcohol per week*: 4

A dramatic decrease from the ~13 units of 10 years ago, mostly because I no longer drink socially.

## Technology

*Laptop*: Asus Chromebook

Interestingly, the previous post mentions I bought a new laptop that year, and I also bought a new laptop this year. I got a Chromebook because you can get a 15", decent spec one for pretty cheap, and I figured it'd be less hassle than getting a Windows one and installing linux.

As for Chrome OS, there have been a couple of 'inconveniences', but for the most part, it's been good.

*Phone*: OnePlus 6T

which I got 2 years ago. I was considering getting a new phone this year, but was unimpressed with the 8T. And the 6T is still good; except for having to use USB-C for headphones. I also considered getting a Pixel 4 5G, primarily because it has a 3.5mm headphone jack.

One other thing I discussed at length in the previous post was twitter usage. I dropped twitter several years ago, so all the stats for that are 0.

## Travel

(via Google Maps/Google Fit)

I dropped foursquare a good while ago. Also, with covid, there hasn't been much travel.

*Long distance train journeys*: 1 (~130 miles)

To High Wycombe at the start of the year, for a work meeting.

*Times outside the house since March*: 7

Mostly to go to the barbers

*Haircuts at home*: 3

### Steps

*Total steps*: 328,145

*Average steps per day*: 896

*Most steps in one day*: 5,810 (~1.9 miles)

*Fewest steps in one day*: 0

...after I put my back out, and was bedridden for 3 days.

Note - steps were tracked with Google fit, using my phone's accelerometer, so is likely an under-count (but not by a lot).

# Summary

All together, that means my average day works out at:
- 31% sleep
- 30% podcasts
- 19% TV/movies
- 10% music
- 6% YouTube
- 4% other
