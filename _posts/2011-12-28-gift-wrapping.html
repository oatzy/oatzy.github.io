In these times of austerity, one has to be economical with one's wrapping paper.<br /><br />Yeah, I know, this would have been much more useful about a week ago. But I just never got around to it. And I use the word 'useful' loosely; any saving one might get from these 'techniques' will most likely be insignificant.<br /><br />Nonetheless...<br /><br /><br /><b>Rectangles</b><br /><br />All gifts - no matter shape or size - can be wrapped with a rectangular piece of paper.<br /><br />This is easily proved. However doing so may not be the neatest or most efficient approach. For example, it's easy to efficiently wrap a cuboid (book, DVD, box) with a rectangular piece of paper, it's less easy to wrap a bike (efficiently) with a single, and in this case, very large piece. However, in the case of a bike, one could use several, smaller pieces of paper for more efficient wrapping.<br /><br />For a ball, one might be tempted to say that a more unusual shape - maybe a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron">truncated icosahedral</a> shell - would be more efficient. However, cutting out such a shape would result in lots of little slivers of waste, and would take a lot of time and effort. Instead, it's usually easier, and not greatly inefficient to just use a rectangular piece, and some creative folding and scrunching.<br /><br />So here's the point - for a given gift, we can define a rectangle (or set of rectangles) which most efficiently wraps that gift.<br /><br />For a cuboid of sides L(ength), W(idth), H(eight), the minimum paper would be: <i>(H+L)</i> by <i>2(H+W)</i>, with a bit extra for overlap.<br /><br />For a cylinder of dimensions H(eight) and R(adius), the paper would need to be: <i>2PI*R</i> by <i>(H+2R)</i>, and a bit.<br /><br />[<i>Proof that these cuts are optimal is left as an exercise for the reader.</i>] <br /><br />For other shapes, this may be more tricky to determine, but for the sake of arguing, we will assume we know all the required rectangle's dimensions.<br /><br /><br /><b>Bin Packing</b><br /><br />So for a given collection of gifts to be wrapped, we have defined a set of rectangles. We now have to determine the most efficient way to cut these out from rolls of wrapping paper - i.e. a large rectangle, ~ 1m x 4m.<br /><br />This is similar to solving a two-dimensional version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem">Bin Packing problem</a>.<br /><br />In the Bin Packing problem, we have several bins (cuboids) of fixed dimensions, and a collection of smaller cuboidal objects. The problem is to pack the objects into as few bins a possible - i.e. find an efficient way of fitting cuboids into boxes.<br /><br />The problem is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hard">NP-Hard</a>, meaning that finding the optimal solution can take a very long time. However, there are algorithms which are fast and give <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm">adequately optimal</a> solutions.<br /><br />One, in particular, is called the First Fit algorithm, and it works something like this:<br /><br />1) Sort the rectangles into size order<br />2) Cut out the largest pieces still in the set<br />2 i) If there is not enough paper left on the current roll, move on to the next/start a new roll<br />3) Repeat (in descending size order) until there are no more pieces left to cut.<br /><br />There are also instructions for how to place the rectangles, for example first fit from bottom and right, to left and top.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmg12GMyatQ/UL0VyvuDxaI/AAAAAAAABBA/RAk3HcImtsg/s1600/sort-wrap.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmg12GMyatQ/UL0VyvuDxaI/AAAAAAAABBA/RAk3HcImtsg/s1600/sort-wrap.png" /></a></div>This <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/web-image/rectanglepacker.aspx">article</a> gives a more precise description of a similar algorithm, though that one is defined for a 'roll' of non-restricted dimensions.<br /><br /><br /><b>Realistically</b><br /><br />That's all well and good mathematically. But in the real world, it's likely more trouble to solve the problem than the saving in paper is worth.<br /><br />However, the general principle of the algorithm can be loosely applied (if indeed it isn't the approach you already use) to improve on efficiency.<br /><br />In general, you can easily sight-guess which gift in going to require the largest amount of paper. And from that you can apply the First Fit algorithm.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">One change I make is, cut out and wrap the largest one left, first. Then wrap the gift(s) which best fits the off-cut.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z-K2CgqAjvc/UL0WAIv5l3I/AAAAAAAABBI/fTKCfL0Kq60/s1600/offcut-diagram.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z-K2CgqAjvc/UL0WAIv5l3I/AAAAAAAABBI/fTKCfL0Kq60/s1600/offcut-diagram.png" /></a></div>This is particularly good for rolls, where you want to unroll and use it a 'slice' at a time (rather than unrolling the whole thing).<br /><br /><br />Anyway, something to think about next time you happen to be wrapping a large number of gifts.<br /><br />Even better if you can get some of that Tesco wrapping paper with the grid on the back.<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.<br /><br /><br />[No wasted paper from my wrapping this year. Just saying.]
