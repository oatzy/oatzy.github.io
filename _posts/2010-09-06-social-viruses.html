In online social networks, ideas can spread between users like viruses. Literally. And this means that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelling_in_Epidemiology">mathematical models</a> of epidemics can be applied directly to the spread of memes, tweets/RTs, links, news, viral marketing, etc.<br /><br /><br /><b>25 Random Things</b><br /><br />The first example is the "<i>25 things</i>" meme that was going around Facebook a short while back. How it worked was, a user would write `25 random things` about themself then 'tag' 25 friends.<br /><br />In the wake of this phenomenon, <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2211068">Slate.com</a> took a survey of a number of users, asking them when they first encountered the meme and if and when they participated.<br /><br />This information was then sent to a biology professor, who used it to model the spread of the meme through Facebook, using the (<a href="http://oatzy.blogspot.com/2010/09/modelling-zombie-apocalypse.html">previously mentioned</a>) SIR model.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TIVHP9VPEcI/AAAAAAAAAVM/vNlEgQ2O_DQ/s1600/25things.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TIVHP9VPEcI/AAAAAAAAAVM/vNlEgQ2O_DQ/s320/25things.png" /></a></div>Now what's particularly special and nice about  the "<i>25 things</i>" is that, because of the tagging, the contact rate is 25 - i.e. each 'infected' individual tried to pass the 'infection' on  to 25 other people.<br /><br />And what the modelling found was that on average 1.27 of  those 25 people would become 'infected' themselves. Which is a nice example and a nice demonstration of how the spread of memes resembles the spread of viruses.<br /><br /><br /><b>Brighten Up Your Day..</b><br /><br /><i>..by moving at least one of Tony Blair's books to the crime section in your local bookshop</i><br /><br />In particular here, I'm looking at the way tweets and memes spread through Twitter - such as the "<i>Crime-Section Blair</i>" and the "<i>Status Copy</i>".<br /><br />One of the main differences between these two is that one was spread (primarily) by RTing, while the other was spread by direct copy/pasting. But for all intents and purposes, that difference doesn't have a significant effect on spreading.<br /><br />The key difference between Twitter and Facebook is to do with contact rate and clustering.<br /><br />In the "<i>25 things</i>" meme, the contact rate was a constant 25. But even in general Facebook users are, on average, in contact with about <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news183791343.html">150 people</a> (friends). And generally, there's not that much variation from  this average.<br /><br />With Twitter, on the other hand, the people you might come into  contact with varies <i>WIDELY</i>.<br /><br />I tried looking up figures for average  number of followers per user, but couldn't find one definitive answer. For demonstrative purposes, I'm going with the one from the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/jun/29/twitter-users-average-api-traffic">Guardian</a> - 126.<br /><br />Now I currently have  about 100 followers, which is close to the 'average'. Stephen Fry, on the other hand, has 1,756,00  followers - 5 orders of magnitude larger, and a significant attenuation from the 'average'. And  this degree of variation among users has a massive effect when trying to model spread on Twitter.<br /><br /><br /><b>An Analogy</b><br /><br />So take, for example, some air-borne virus - say, flu.<br /><br />If '<i>patient zero</i>' stays relatively contained - equivalent of staying at home - the only people likely to catch the virus are those immediately around them.<br /><br />If on the other hand '<i>patient zero</i>' goes to a mass-populated area - say a shopping centre, or a hospital - the virus will find more victims. And those victims will spread out and pass it on to more people, and the virus will spread more throughout the general population - an epidemic.<br /><br />In this analogy then, the 'house' is equivalent to a relatively small and contained network of friends - for example, me and my small group of followers. A tweet is unlikely to spread much outside of my network.<br /><br />Celebrities, on the other hand are the man in the shopping centre, or a 'care-giver' at a hospital - they expose the 'virus' to a large number of people. And anyone who's then 'infected' will carry that on to their own network. And then it may even spread out more from there.<br /><br />So for a '<i>tweet epidemic</i>', a tweet/RT has to come into contact with one of these mass connectors (as <a href="http://oatzy.blogspot.com/2010/09/forced-trending-topics.html">previously</a> <a href="http://oatzy.blogspot.com/2010/09/six-degrees-and-how-we-met.html">discussed</a>). <br /><br /><br /><b>Sometimes I Just Want To Copy Someone Else's Status,..</b><br /><br /><i>..Word for Word, and See If They Notice.</i><br /><br />The major different between the "<i>Blair</i>" meme and the "<i>Copy</i>" meme, is that in the former, '<i>patient zero</i>' was a 'connector' - highly influential with lots of followers. So it's not that surprising that it spread.<br /><br />[And it was also funny, which made it more <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/tony+blairaposs+book+takes+unexpected+journey/3759707">'contagious'</a>.]<br /><br />The problem with the "<i>Copy</i>" meme is that, by it's nature, it's harder to trace back to it's original source. <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sometimes-i-just-want-to-copy-someone-else%E2%80%99s-status">Know Your Meme</a> cites the first appearance<i>*</i> as being on <i>August 26th</i> by @<i>Tim_Waters</i> - a Leeds man with 507 followers. Which isn't a significant number.<br /><br />But not long after his initial tweet, it reached @<i>elspethjane</i> (3,100 followers) and a bit later <i>Dolly Parton</i> (722,000 followers) - so by this point it had reached epidemic, and was spreading like wildfire.<br /><br />If you're a frequent Twitter (or even Facebook) user, no doubt you saw it at least once.<br /><br />Anyway, all this complicates things - trying to model if and how a tweet will reach a connector. One could assume that in the case of the "<i>Copy</i>" meme, this came down to it's high 'contagiousness' - that it survived long enough to spread to one or more connectors.<br /><br /><br /><b>Visual Demonstration</b><br /><br />These are based on a <a href="http://oatzy.blogspot.com/2010/07/follow-up-twitter-network.html">previous</a> graph of my Twitter follows. For this, we pretend that this small network is completely isolated.<br /><br />In this first one, the red circle in the middle posts a tweet. The purple circles are the people who see that tweet:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TIVSgtGRMkI/AAAAAAAAAVU/y6ukFoTuruE/s1600/graph-stripped-RT1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TIVSgtGRMkI/AAAAAAAAAVU/y6ukFoTuruE/s320/graph-stripped-RT1.png" /></a></div>So the tweet is already reaching 7 people. Now if the node labelled 2 ReTweets, then only one more person will see it (total audience 8).<br /><br />If node 1 RTs, then the tweet reaches an extra 3 people (10 people total). So in this case, 1 is more of a connector than 2.<br /><br />For a better example of the importance of connectors, we have the below:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TIVTXPDRUoI/AAAAAAAAAVc/SpU_QefrIZ8/s1600/graph-stripped-RT2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TIVTXPDRUoI/AAAAAAAAAVc/SpU_QefrIZ8/s320/graph-stripped-RT2.png" /></a></div>Again, red tweets, purple are audience. So in this case, there's only an audience of 2. And if the node at the bottom RTs, it won't matter.<br /><br />If the circled node RTs, though, the tweet will reach 2 more people - one of whom is a mass-connector, who could spread it to an additional 5 people, which could lead to it spreading even further.<br /><br />So ultimately, the number of people following you is only as important as <i>who</i> those people are. The red circle may only have 2 'followers', but via the circled node, they could still reach all or most of the entire population, with little difficulty.<br /><br /><br /><b>Modelling Spread</b><br /><br />So it comes down to this - on Facebook,  information or memes will spread fairly uniformly, following the SIR  model. <br /><br />And at it's most basic level, the spread of tweets can be sufficiently modeled by the SIR approach as well. Especially if the tweet doesn't encounter a mass-connector, and instead spreads through a population whose followers count is sufficiently close to that ~150 average.<br /><br />For example, if I post something worth RTing, at best it's going to go maybe 2 generations out. And this <i>could</i> be described by the SIR equations. Though given degree of spread, it'd hardly be worth it.<br /><br />The limitation of the SIR equations though, is that it assumes homogenous mixing of susceptible and infected - i.e. that everyone in the population has equal odds of being infected. But as with the analogy, on Twitter you get more clustering, so that's not necessarily the case.<br /><br />Instead, you have to use <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2003/meyers.html">this</a> approach, where you plot out a situation-specific network graph of the system - like the above diagrams - and work from that. And given that Twitter has in excess of 4 million users, that's a little beyond my resources and inclination<i>**</i>.<br /><br />But basically, if a tweet hits a connector, it will spread like swine-flu hysteria.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Oatzy. <br /><br /><br />* <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/26/twitter-human-virus/">TechCrunch</a> found an earlier example on the <i>19th of August</i> - a Bieber fan  with 809 followers. It's hard to say if Tim wrote the (almost  identical) tweet independent of her, or if she was the true 'patient zero'.<br /><br />** This guy crawled Twitter and got connections for most of the users (at the time of crawling).
