The run up to Christmas is over, and hopefully everyone has their Christmas shopping done. So now seems like as good a time as any to look at what the crowds are doing:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WP963EM_myc/TvZlOLVf-kI/AAAAAAAAAuE/MQ1OyTMmHuw/s1600/christmas-eve-graph.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WP963EM_myc/TvZlOLVf-kI/AAAAAAAAAuE/MQ1OyTMmHuw/s400/christmas-eve-graph.png" width="400" /></a></div>Now that is interesting. I think it is, anyway.<br /><br />So first of all, the weekday spikes. It seems like a significant number of people left their Christmas shopping to the last week. Now fair enough if they've only just finished work/university/whatever.<br /><br />Notice also the general week-on-week trend for the weekdays.<br /><br />But more importantly than all that, look at today - Christmas Eve.<br /><br /><br /><b>Anti-Crowds</b><br /> <br />Everyone 'knows' that going shopping on Christmas Eve is suicidal. It's a well known clich√©. But that's the thing - everyone thinks it's going to be insanely busy, so a lot of people avoid shopping centres.<br /><br />But then, this means the shopping centres end up practically deserted (by Christmas standards). And it's not necessarily the result of what I mentioned <a href="http://oatzy.blogspot.com/2011/12/panic-saturday.html">last time</a> - I was out there, and I saw the lack of crowds.<br /><br />It's an interesting, and previously studied phenomenon.<br /><br />I won't go into too much detail, cause it's past midnight on Christmas Eve. But if you're interested in this effect, and in this sort of thing in general, I would suggest reading up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system">Complexity Theory</a>. In particular, I'd recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Simply-Complexity-Clear-Guide-Theory/dp/1851686304/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324771608&amp;sr=8-1">this book</a>, which covers this exact subject in one of the early chapters.<br /><br /><br />Of course, if we were looking at supermarkets, that would be a different story..<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.<br /><br /><br />[<span style="color: red;">M</span><span style="color: #38761d;">e</span><span style="color: red;">r</span><span style="color: #38761d;">r</span><span style="color: red;">y</span> <span style="color: #38761d;">C</span><span style="color: red;">h</span><span style="color: #38761d;">r</span><span style="color: red;">i</span><span style="color: #38761d;">s</span><span style="color: red;">t</span><span style="color: #38761d;">m</span><span style="color: red;">a</span><span style="color: #38761d;">s</span>!]
