If you'll recall, in early February I created a T-shirt calendar - that is, a 'calendar' where each square is coloured according to the colour of the T-shirt I wore on that day. Previous post <a href="http://oatzy.blogspot.com/2011/02/t-shirt-calendar.html">here</a>. <br /><br />So, with half the year more or less done, here's what the calendar is looking like now,<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7GY2YWmUV_c/Tg5TRDC6ZZI/AAAAAAAAAiY/iArisKb-er8/s1600/tshirt-calendar.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="371" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7GY2YWmUV_c/Tg5TRDC6ZZI/AAAAAAAAAiY/iArisKb-er8/s400/tshirt-calendar.png" width="400" /></a></div>There's not really much else to say on the subject, other than to note that there's very little pattern to it, and that I wear a lot of green T-shirts.<br /><br />So ultimately we're left gazing upon it's random patch-work glory, and wondering what its purpose or meaning might be.<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.<br /><br /><br />[<i>For what it's worth.</i>]
