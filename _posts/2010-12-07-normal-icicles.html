Long story short, I was playing with my dad's fancy camera and took this (amongst others) photo of some icicles<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TP7ITCkjCaI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/moffsv9JIhI/s1600/DSCF0306-edit.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TP7ITCkjCaI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/moffsv9JIhI/s320/DSCF0306-edit.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Which I was pretty proud of. So proud in fact that I sat and stared at it for longer than is perhaps sane.<br /><br />As you'll notice, the individual icicles are clustered into groups, with the longest of the groups in the middle and getting progressively smaller moving outwards.<br /><br /><br /><b>Normal Distribution</b><br /><br />The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a> is one of those things that pops up everywhere. For example if you measure the heights of a significantly large group of people and plot the results you'll get a graph shaped something similar to <a href="http://www.usablestats.com/lessons/normal">this</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.usablestats.com/images/men_women_height_histogram.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://www.usablestats.com/images/men_women_height_histogram.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>With the averages approximately in the middle, and the width/height of the curves based on the standard deviation of the sample.<br /><br />Another nice example, go to Amazon and look at the customer ratings for anything. If a large enough number of people have rated it, you'll probably notice this same sort of shape; usually with the one star rating spiking to not fit the pattern (damn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_%28contemporary_subculture%29#1990s_and_2000s">hipsters</a>). Some are more pronounced fits than others.<br /><br />And as I say, this sort of thing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Occurrence">shows up</a> all over the place. This is partly due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit theorem</a>, but that's a whole other kettle of fish.<br /><br /><br /><b>Equations Everywhere</b><br /><br />I was partly inspired by a program I recently watched - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wgq0l">The Joy of Stats</a> - and partly by the website "<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/01/pl_arts_found/">Found Functions</a>", whose creator finds graphs (and their accompanying formulas) in photos of everyday scenes.<br /><br />I flipped the photo vertically (for clarity) and skewed it slightly to try to account for the fact that it was taken side-on, then put some normal curves on it to hopefully prove I'm not just crazy and imagining it<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TP7NBvUR9JI/AAAAAAAAAaY/fX0Maj4jdII/s1600/DSCF0306-edit-norms2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TP7NBvUR9JI/AAAAAAAAAaY/fX0Maj4jdII/s320/DSCF0306-edit-norms2.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>And another one<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TP7WMvufEkI/AAAAAAAAAag/OiX0toyD9b8/s1600/DSCF0314-edit-norms.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="198" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TP7WMvufEkI/AAAAAAAAAag/OiX0toyD9b8/s320/DSCF0314-edit-norms.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />They're not perfect fits, partly due to perspective. But you hopefully get the idea. Why do the icicles form like that? Because nature's just fantastic in that way.<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.
