As a sort of quick follow-up to yesterday's post. I've re-edited the graph from last time to demonstrate how a 'virus' might spread through that network.<br /><br />For this, we assume a 0.5 contact rate - that is, a person in contact with an infective has a 50:50 chance of becoming infected in the next 'turn'. An Infective will recover after one turn.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">In the diagrams, then, red circle means infected; orange circle means exposed and able to catch the infection; blue circle means recovered and not able to catch the infection again. White circles are susceptible to infection, but not exposed to it.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /><object height="266" id="BLOG_video-18fb47020ebedb54" class="BLOG_video_class" contentid="18fb47020ebedb54" width="320"></object></div>So in this case, that all important central connector gets infected (eventually) and as a result, 73% of the total network gets infected.<br /><br />If it hadn't, only 40% of the network would've been infected - 53% if all the nodes on that side were infected.<br /><br />Of course, this is only one possible course for the infection. And if the contact rate were lower, it probably wouldn't have spread through as much of the network.<br /><br />Anyway. It's just a nice way of showing how modelling epidemics on an asymmetrical network works.<br /><br />Good.<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.
