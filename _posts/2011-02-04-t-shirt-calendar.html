When I was putting together the <a href="http://oatzy.blogspot.com/2011/01/life-by-numbers-end-of-year-report.html">Life by Numbers</a> blog, I was thinking about other things I could track, without the tracking thing becoming too intrusive.<br /><br />First couple of things I did was signing up for <a href="http://gomiso.com/u/oatzy">miso</a> to track TV and film viewing habits, as well as <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/oatzy/profile">RunKeeper</a> to track my movements on foot (which wouldn't be logged with FourSquare). So far, RunKeeper - or perhaps just my phone's GPS - have been a bit of a disappointment. But that's a whole other story.<br /><br />The other thing I did was to take a picture a day of myself. I had nothing in mind specifically to do with the pictures, but thought why not?<br /><br />The obvious use is to do one of those time-lapse, slideshow thing. But those are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=picture+a+day+time+lapse&amp;page=&amp;utm_source=opensearch">dime-a-dozen</a>. And besides that, the pictures aren't all head on and centred, so you wouldn't really get the same effect.<br /><br /><br /><b>Details</b><br /><br />Instead, I thought about what was actually in the pictures - what could be gleaned from them.<br /><br />First things that come to mind are (a) when I shave, and (b) when I get my haircut. And they're things I might come back to once I have more than a months worth of pictures; I don't shave that often.<br /><br />So the only other thing is what I'm wearing.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TU2MQtEOkNI/AAAAAAAAAeo/K6tX5v8rt5c/s1600/t-shirts-edit.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="285" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TU2MQtEOkNI/AAAAAAAAAeo/K6tX5v8rt5c/s400/t-shirts-edit.png" width="400" /></a></div>The above is a sort of calendar - <i>Sunday 2nd of January</i> to <i>Friday 3rd of February</i> - where each square is coloured to match (as closely as possible) the primary colour of the t-shirt I wore on that day.<br /><br /><strike>The last square's crossed out because I haven't decided yet what t-shirt I'm going to wear tomorrow.</strike><br />[edit] - I wore a green t-shirt.<br /><br /><br />There's not really much logic to it, beside that when I pick a t-shirt I don't pick one I can <i>remember</i> wearing within the last week. Yes, I have several green t-shirts.<br /><br />Otherwise, it mostly just looks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_the_Patchwork_Elephant">Elmer the Elephant</a>. But it is an interesting way of represent the dataset, even if it serves no useful purpose other than to suggest that green might be my favourite colour.<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.
