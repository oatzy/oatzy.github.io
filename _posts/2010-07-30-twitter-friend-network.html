I'll get to the technical stuff shortly. All you need to know right now is that this is a network map showing who follows each other.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TFNuPa_tL5I/AAAAAAAAAF0/pgQGoD1HeAg/s1600/follow-network.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="335" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TFNuPa_tL5I/AAAAAAAAAF0/pgQGoD1HeAg/s400/follow-network.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Size of the bubbles is proportional to the number of links to it.<br /><br />That big blob in the middle that everyone's connected to is me, obviously. It should be labelled, but, apparently it hates me.<br /><br />Oh, and that's just a screen shot up there. The real, interactive version is <a href="http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/visualizations/friend-follows-2">here</a>.<br /><br />Okay, so what happened was I was playing with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/">Twitter API for Python</a>. I already had this idea - for the people I follow, who follows who (within that group)? Now when I first thought of the idea, I thought I'd have to go through everyone by hand. So thank God for the API.<br /><br />What the code does [you can find it <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4635169/twitterFollows.py">here</a> if you're interested] is retrieve a list of the people I follow, then for each user checks which of the other users in the list they follow. Then outputs the result.<br /><br />I know, that's basically what I said up there. But it really is that straight forward.<br /><br />Well, it actually wasn't that straight forward. For some reason it missed out some connection that I know were there. In particular, Charlie Brooker was causing a few problems (and I'll be damned if I know why).<br /><br />But I tried my best to make do, and the first graph was a complete and utter mess - the celebrities were causing too much 'noise'. It was obscuring the graph.<br /><br />So once I'd removed the celebrities, Charlie's delinquency wasn't a problem anymore. That being said, I did have to go through the list afterwards making a few corrections. And there may still be errors in the data. If you spot any, please let me know.<br /><br />And that's pretty much it.<br /><br />But while I'm on the subject, the website I used to build the graph was <a href="http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/">ManyEyes</a> [brought to you by IBM]. It does a crap load of different graphs and infographical goodness, and it's definitely worth checking out and having a play with.<br /><br />So yeah. Enjoy. And if you make any fancy graphs of your own, please do share.<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.<br /><br /><br />[edit] - I created a more stripped down <a href="http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/visualizations/friend-follows-3">version</a> by removing the people who never tweet. It looks a lot more clear.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
