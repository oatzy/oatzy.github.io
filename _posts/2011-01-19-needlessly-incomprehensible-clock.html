I'd be massively exaggerating if I said I had insomnia. I just have difficulty getting to sleep; I struggle to 'switch off' my brain.<br /><br />So while I was trying to get to sleep last night, I somehow got on to designing this clock,<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TTd7VB8vJtI/AAAAAAAAAdA/nDZfRnTo-HE/s1600/clock.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TTd7VB8vJtI/AAAAAAAAAdA/nDZfRnTo-HE/s1600/clock.jpg" /></a></div>The time, in case you couldn't work it out, is <i>23:46:52</i><br /><br />How does it work? It's part binary, but with an analogue-style layout. The central pie is seconds, the middle ring in minutes and the outer ring is hours.<br /><br />Each ring is divided into chunks, sized in proportion to the powers of 2 that they represent. To get the time, you simply add up the 'illuminated' chunks.<br /><br />So in the above example:<br />hours = 1+2+4+16 = 23<br />minutes = 2+4+8+32 = 46<br />seconds = 4+16+32 = 52<br /><br />It was even more incomprehensible when all the chunks were the same colour. There's also this slightly more comprehensible one, where all the chunks are the same size (within a given ring).<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TTgxzxYW_1I/AAAAAAAAAdE/AQO5gk7P-v8/s1600/Untitled-1-alt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_p_IGrzjF6JY/TTgxzxYW_1I/AAAAAAAAAdE/AQO5gk7P-v8/s1600/Untitled-1-alt.jpg" /></a></div>The time on that one is <i>12:52:11</i><br /><br />There's a working version of the first <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4635169/time/time2/index.htm">here</a>, and of the second <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4635169/time/time2/index-alt.htm">here</a>. It's written in JavaScript with the help of the <a href="http://jsdraw2d.jsfiction.com/">jsDraw</a> library.<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.
