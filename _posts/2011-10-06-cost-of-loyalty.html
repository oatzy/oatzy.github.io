So if you have a loyalty card for, say, Costa you will get 5 points for every pound you spend. One point is worth 1 pence, so you're effectively saving 5p from each £1 you spend - a saving of 5%, right?<br /><br />Yeah, it's not that simple.<br /><br />For one thing, if you think of it as paying full price then getting 5p back per £1, then there's the restriction that these 5 pences you're 'saving' can only be spent in Costa. Also, you only get points for the whole pounds you spend (not the pence).<br /><br />So what <i>are</i> you saving?<br /><br />Think of it this way - let's say every time you go to Costa you buy the same thing, spending the same amount of money each time.<br /><br />The question then is, <i><b>how many visits does it take to earn enough points to get your usual order for free?</b></i><br /><br /><br />Okay, so we have our usual order, with price P. The amount of money you 'save' (in the form of points) per visits is 0.05*floor(P). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_function">floor function</a> - f() from now on - rounds the price down to the nearest pound, since you don't get points for pennies.<br /><br />So we want to find the number, N, of purchases we need for the total points value to be greater than or equal to our order price P. In other words:<br /><br /><i>0.05*f(P)*N = P</i><br /><br />or&nbsp; <i>N = P/(0.05*f(P))</i><br /><br />Now, lets start by looking at the simplest case, where P is an exact number of pounds - i.e. P = f(P)<br /><br />In this case, P and f(P) cancel each other out, so <i>N = 20</i>. Notice, regardless of whether your order is £1 or £20, it will always take 20 visits to get one 'free'.<br /><br />More generally, the equation becomes <i>N = ceil(20*P/f(P))</i><br /><br />Where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_function">ceil</a> is a function which rounds the value up to the nearest whole number. Because there's no such thing as a fractional visit, unless you count a visit in which you spend less than usual. Anyway.<br /><br />Okay, so lets look at an example - a pot of tea costs about £1.60. So we work out N = ceil(20*1.6/f(1.6)) = ceil(32/1) = 32 visits. And just to check, for a pot of tea you get 5 points per visit (5p), and 32*0.05 = 1.60 = the price of a pot of tea. Perfect.<br /><br /><br /><b>Now. What about savings?</b><br /><br />In the tea example, you're buying 32 pots of tea and getting one for free. Which isn't a great saving, but it is a saving nonetheless.<br /><br />So, the total amount you spend is <i>P*N</i>, and you're getting <i>N+1</i> pots. That means the effective price per cup works out at <i>P*N/(N+1)</i>.<br /><br />For tea, that means you're effectively paying ~£1.55 per pot - a saving (S) of 5p per pot. What's that saving as a percent? Without going into too much detail, it turns out it's <i>%S = 1/(N+1)</i>.<br /><br />Which works out at 3% for tea. Which is less than the 5% saving you might have expected.<br /><br /><br /><b>Incidentally..</b><br /><br />The example for when the price is an exact number of pounds turns out to offer an effective saving of ~4.76%. Which, again, is less than 5%, but a little better. This, by the way, is also the <i>maximum</i> % saving you can achieve with a Costa card.<br /><br />In general, the % saving is much worse when the pence amount of P is high and the pound amount is low - the worst case being when the price is £1.99. This would require 40 visits to 'get one free' and offers a saving of only 2.4%.<br /><br />So based on best and worst case scenarios, we can say that your % saving will always be between 2.4% and 4.8%. Similarly, visits required to get one free, N, will always be between 20 and 40.<br /><br />[In fact, the absolute worst case is when P is less than 1, in which case you never get any points.]<br /><br /><br /><b>But to clarify..</b><br /><br />This 'saving' is the saving over what you would have paid if you bought N+1 pots of tea and didn't have a loyalty card - i.e. not getting the N+1th one for free.<br /><br />But what if you could spend the money you saved on something else?<br /><br />Think of it this way - you've bought N pots of tea, and thanks to the loyalty card, you've saved the equivalent of the cost of one more pot of tea (£1.60). In this case, the saving per pot bought would be P/N. For the pot of tea, that's 1.60/32 = 5p.<br /><br />To get the percent saving (per order), we divide this number by total price, P. For tea that works out at 3.1%. In fact, this is equivalent to the point-value saved per purchase, divided by the full order price - i.e. <i>0.05*f(P)/P == 1/N</i><br /><br />So for the whole-pound values, this does, in fact, work out at a 5% saving. And the worst saving is still for £1.99 purchases, now working out at a 2.5% saving.<br /><br /><br /><b>One more thing</b><br /><br />All of this also goes for Tesco, and Waterstones, and wherever else does money-for-points loyalty cards too. You just replace 0.05 with however many points you get per pound, divided by 100 (e.g. Tesco = 0.01).<br /><br />If we call this value <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho">rho</a> (which looks a bit like a lower-case p), then the general formulas are:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HzHLVAS5CUQ/To3AB4JhUEI/AAAAAAAAAr8/lTiCTAMR6Jo/s1600/loyalty-formulas.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HzHLVAS5CUQ/To3AB4JhUEI/AAAAAAAAAr8/lTiCTAMR6Jo/s1600/loyalty-formulas.png" /></a></div>But again, we're assuming you spend approximately the same amount (P) every time you visit a given place. If not, things get tricky. For a rough estimate, one thing we can try is using an average per visit spend (Pbar).<br /><br />One other thing we can do is replace the P on the top of the fraction with a target points/saving; replacing f(P) with f(Pbar) if necessary.<br /><br />So, for example, if the average order (Pbar) is £3.55 and you want enough points to get a free slice lemon cake (£2.50), then it will take N = 17 visits.<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.
