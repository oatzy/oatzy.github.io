<b>Shutter Island</b><br /><br />You know you've seen a good film when you're left with a lingering feeling of unease once the film's over. It happened after <i>Inception</i>, and it happened after this.<br /><br />Based on a book by <i>Dennis Lehane</i>, it's the story of a state trooper investigating a missing patient from from an isolated island-based institute for the criminally insane. Or so it would seem.<br /><br />It's a twist ending movie. And your experience with the twist may vary. I can't say how obvious it is, but I worked it out before seeing the film, but that didn't remove any from it. Though I'm sure the viewing experience would've been quite different if I hadn't. Still, like <i>Fight Club</i>, knowing what's coming doesn't ruin the film at all.<br /><br />In fact, while I guessed the major twist, that wasn't all there was to it. And the reveal-all flashback scene to what happened in Leo's past is genuinely unsettling.<br /><br />It's visually appealing, and in terms of the acting, Leo was fantastic. As was <i>Ben Kingsley</i>. If I ever go batshit, I hope I have a psychotherapist like him. <br /><br />Overall, I reckon it's made it onto my favourites list, so as you'd probably expect, it comes highly recommended from me. Watch it!<br /><br /><b><br />The Road</b><br /><br />First of all, as far as I can recall, I've never cried at a movie. And I mean actually cried. Sure, I've been close to tears a few times. But <i>The Road</i>... I don't know why, but that ending really got me<i>*</i>.<br /><br />It's based on a book by <i>Cormac McCarthy</i>, who also wrote <i>No Country for Old Men</i>, another great film. The most basic description I can come up with is that it's the story of a father and son trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. But unlike other post-apocalyptic films, the dangers are simply from other survivor, who chose to survive by cannibalism, theft, whatever it takes - not some supernatural horror.<br /><br />It's a slow burner, unusual in a world of more fast-paced, action-filled films. But when the action does come, it's all the more tense. Unlike a lot of horror film, you're not desensitised to the violence and horror, which makes it all the more distressing. And the film as a whole has a general uncomfortable feel to it. But in a good way.<br /><br />It seems like one of those films that will likely be on so many lists of films to see before you die.. Not quite a cult classic, but certainly not mainstream, despite its critical acclaim.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it comes with my recommendation.<br /><br />[*I'm not claiming to be a really macho manly man who doesn't cry for anyone or anything. I just generally.. don't. Maybe I'm just dead inside :p]<br /><br /><b><br />The Departed</b><br /><br />I seem to have been seeing a lot of <i>Mr DiCaprio</i> recently. You judge for yourself whether that's a good or bad thing. Also staring <i>Matt Damon</i> and an aging <i>Jack Nicholson</i>, it's a modern mafia film (directed my <i>Martin Scorsese</i>), and a decent one at that.<br /><br />It's also a little mind fuck-y - you have the cops and the gangsters, each with a rat on the other side and each looking for the other's rat, and it's not entirely clear who is actually on who's side.<br /><br />Okay, so when I said mind fuck-y, what I meant was confusing. The unfortunate thing is, due to my revising at the time, I didn't entirely pay attention to it. So instead, I'm going to bring up <i>The Simpsons</i>.<br /><br />As per the memeic refrain - <i>Simpsons did it!</i> In an episode when Skinner introduces a new student into the school - Donny - meant to befriend Bart and rat on all his planned pranks. They even go so far as to include the main musical theme from <i>The Departed</i> and parody (among other scenes) the final cut-scene - an actual rat walking across the background. And in <i>The Simpsons</i>, Ralph popping up to say "<i>The rat symbolises obviousness</i>".<br /><br />There's also an episode of <i>South Park</i> that seems to parody the end, where the cops are randomly executing each other for some, not entirely clear reason.<br /><br />Well, I say not entirely clear - it may have been more clear if I'd been paying attention.<br />It's not what I'd call a must see film. But I wouldn't discourage you from seeing it either. I'll leave it up to your judgement.<br /><br /><br /><b>Unbreakable</b><br /><br />It was sold to me as how a superhero origin story should be done. And it was certainly impressive. <i>M. Night Shyamalan</i> has been getting a lot of abuse lately, but we have to remember, there was a time when he was a respected director. And this is one of his better movies.<br /><br />As I said above, it is a superhero (and nemesis) origin story. And a very good one at that, not least because it convincingly suggests that heroes could exist in the real world. Possibly. And you have little emotional sub-plots in there as well. But what really wins it is <i>Samuel L. Jackson</i> - the Glass Man - brittle-bone sufferer. The Antithesis of <i>Bruce Willis</i>'s hero. <br /><br />But really, <i>Samuel L.</i> is just consistently awesome in everything. And this is certainly no exception. You should see it - especially if you're a comicbook/superheroes fan; but even if you're not.<br /><br />And I'm keeping my fingers crossed that there will be a sequel, and that <i>Shyamalan</i> hasn't completely lost his awesome-movie making abilities. Because the ending really does leave the potential for something great to follow.<br /><br /><br /><b>Good Will Hunting</b><br /><br />So this kid, this delinquent working as a janitor at a university - turns out he's a secret genius. Also, he's <i>Matt Damon</i>. Okay, so if it were that simple, the film would be at risk of being trite. But as you probably already know, this film is critically acclaimed. (And possibly won an Oscar?).<br /><br />I seem to remember that that part was parodied in an episode of <i>Jimmy Neutron</i>. At least, I think it was <i>Jimmy Neutron</i>. Either way. It's always weird seeing a film, having seen various references and parodies before hand. <i>The Godfather</i> is a good example of that (for me, at least).<br /><br />But no, the actual bulk of the movie is in Will's relationship with his psychologist - played by <i>Robin Williams</i>. I have to say, <i>Williams</i> is actually a really good actor when he's not playing a buffoon [See also: <i>One Hour Photo</i>].<br /><br />Okay, so this was another film I only half watch (revising for a maths exam at the time), but what I saw of it was impressive. I might even consider buying it. Possibly. It's probably only about Â£3 in HMV. We'll see how impulsive I'm feeling.<br /><br />Yeah, I'd recommend it. One of those you might want to see on TV before buying it. But it is worth a look.<br /><br /><br /><b>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest</b><br /><br />Here's another parodied one, in particular in <i>The Simpsons</i>. And having seen it, all of a sudden a handful of jokes make a lot more sense. Like Bart kidnapping the old people and taking them for a boat trip, and 'the Chief' that throwing a water fountain through a window to 'escape' the old people's home. Also, a big chunk of the <i>Michael Jackson</i> episode.<br /><br /><i>One Flew</i> centres on criminal <i>Jack Nicholson</i> being sent to a mental hospital and on the people he meets and befriends there. And these patients are at the mercy of Nurse Ratchet - an evil bitch of a woman, who, at one point, guilts one of the patients so much he slits his throat. This leads Jack to try and choke her to death - and as a result, gets lobotomised. Then there's the surprisingly touching/disturbing scene where the lobotomised <i>Nicholson</i> is smothered to death by 'the Chief' - as a mercy killing.<br /><br />It's a damn good film. I suggest you watch it.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning: the first two episode of series 6 of <i>House</i> (wherein House has been committed) bear some resemblance to <i>One Flew</i>, and in and of itself they're a fantastic pair of episodes. The rest of the series is a bit hit and miss, but you should definitely watch those two.<br /><br /><br /><b>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</b><br /><br />I don't know what some of the other reviewers are talking about - misogynistic?! I honestly don't see it. Or maybe I'm just to misogynistic myself to notice? Either way. The point is, it's a good film. And there's a few pretentious, youth/gamer-hating bastards who could use a good slap.<br /><br />Based on a graphic novel by <i>Brian Lee O'Malley</i> - <i>Scott Pilgrim</i>, at it's most basic level, is a 'boy meets girl' love story. Albeit one that's been smashed together with a video-game to form this stunning, visually pleasing fusion of a film. Of course, this will not be to everyone's taste. But it was to mine, and ultimately, that's all that really matters.<br /><br />Oh, and also, Scott has to defeat the girl - Romona Flowers -'s seven evil exes, which he does in true video-game style - compete with the defeated becoming a pile of coins.<br /><br />The film as a whole.. well, I loved it. I've heard other people speak highly of it. But it's kind of a niche film. Odds are, the people who'll like it the most are those around student-aged. Which is not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />It's funny, it's romantic (but not sickeningly so) it's just generally good fun, and it has 'Vegan Police'. Oh, and did I mention it's visually stunning?<br /><br />Yeah. If you're around student age or are just a big nerd (or both), I'd recommend it. If you're not, maybe read up on it first..?<br /><br />[Only downside - not nearly enough <a href="http://fuckyeahprancingcera.tumblr.com/">prancing</a> :p]<br /><br /><br />Oatzy.
